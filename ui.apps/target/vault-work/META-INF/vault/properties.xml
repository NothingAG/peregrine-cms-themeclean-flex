<entry key="description">This is an empty JCR Package where the JCR Content
        can be deployed with.

        This module is deployed with the
        Profile "autoInstallPackage" which deploys both
        this JCR Package as well as the core "OSGi Bundle".
        If you add more modules to your project then you need
        to add them to that profile and include here
        as dependencies.</entry>
